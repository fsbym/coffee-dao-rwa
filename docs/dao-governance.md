# Coffee Shop DAO - Comprehensive Governance Mechanism

## üèõÔ∏è DAO Governance Overview

The Coffee Shop DAO implements a comprehensive decentralized autonomous organization structure that empowers all token holders to participate in the governance of coffee shop operations, financial decisions, and strategic direction.

## üó≥Ô∏è Core Governance Principles

### **1. Token-Based Voting Power**

- **1 Token = 1 Vote**: Direct proportional representation
- **Minimum Balance Required**: No minimum balance to vote (inclusive design)
- **Dynamic Power**: Voting power updates automatically with token balance changes
- **Anti-Whale Protection**: No single address can hold more than 15% of total supply

### **2. Delegated Democracy**

- **Voluntary Delegation**: Token holders can delegate voting power to trusted addresses
- **Revocable at Any Time**: Delegation can be removed without penalty
- **Transparent Tracking**: All delegations are publicly visible on-chain
- **Compound Effect**: Delegates can accumulate voting power from multiple delegators

### **3. Proposal-Driven Decision Making**

- **Open Participation**: Any token holder can create proposals (with minimum threshold)
- **Structured Process**: Standardized proposal lifecycle with clear stages
- **Multiple Categories**: Different types for different decision scopes
- **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track mechanisms for urgent decisions

4. **Formal Publication**: Proposal becomes officially active

### **Phase 2: Discussion (Days 1-3)**

1. **Community Debate**: Open discussion in governance forums
2. **Clarifications**: Proposer answers questions and provides additional details
3. **Amendment Suggestions**: Community can suggest modifications
4. **Expert Input**: Domain experts can provide analysis

1. **Voting Opens**: All eligible token holders can cast votes
2. **Vote Options**: For, Against, Abstain
3. **Reason Recording**: Optional reason strings for transparency
4. **Real-time Tracking**: Live vote counts and quorum progress

2. **Preparation**: Technical preparation for implementation
3. **Execution**: Automatic or manual implementation
4. **Verification**: Confirmation of successful implementation

## üîÑ Voting Mechanisms

### **Direct Voting**

```solidity
function voteWithReason(
    uint256 proposalId,
    uint8 support,      // 0=Against, 1=For, 2=Abstain
    string reason       // Optional explanation
) external
```

**Features**:

- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for cost-effective participation
- **Reason Tracking**: Optional explanations for transparency
- **Single Vote**: One vote per address per proposal
- **Immutable**: Votes cannot be changed once cast

### **Delegated Voting**

```solidity
function delegateVoting(address delegate) external
function undelegateVoting() external
```

**Features**:

- **Flexible**: Delegate to any address
- **Revocable**: Remove delegation at any time
- **Transparent**: All delegations publicly visible
- **Compound**: Delegates can accumulate power from multiple sources

### **Voting Power Calculation**

```solidity
function getVotingPower(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 directPower = balanceOf(account);

    // Remove power if delegated
    if (hasDelegated[account]) directPower = 0;

    // Add delegated power from others
    uint256 delegatedPower = calculateDelegatedPower(account);

    return directPower + delegatedPower;
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Anti-Manipulation Measures
